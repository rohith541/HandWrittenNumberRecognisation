# NumberRecognitionMNIST
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel image of a handwritten digit, labeled with the corresponding digit from 0 to 9. The dataset is divided into two parts: a training set of 50,000 images and a validation set of 10,000 images.

To train a model to recognize digits in the MNIST dataset, various machine learning algorithms can be used, including neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees. However, the most commonly used approach is to train a neural network using the training set.

The neural network architecture used for digit recognition typically consists of an input layer with 784 neurons (corresponding to the 28x28 pixels in each image), one or more hidden layers, and an output layer with 10 neurons (corresponding to the 10 possible digits). The hidden layers can be made up of any number of neurons, and the activation function used can be any function that is differentiable.

During training, the weights and biases of the neural network are adjusted using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The goal is to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted output of the model and the true label of the input image. The most commonly used loss function for digit recognition is the cross-entropy loss.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the digit in new images. The performance of the model is typically evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall on the validation set. A well-trained model can achieve accuracy above 99% on the MNIST dataset.
